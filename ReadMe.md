# ABOUT THIS PROJECT

This is a simple example of executing javascript function in frontend html files
that don't require a backend or any extra frameworks.

### This is limited because:

1. You can't persist (aka save) any of the form results outside of "localstorage" - this is for browser security reasons
2. Everything relies on "vanilla Javascript" and plain html, which means everything must be hard coded and will be tough to customize
3. Overall lacks the common technologies that make life easier with minimal extra effort.
